Hi, I'm Leslie.

I teach statistics and data science at Macalester College with [awesome mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians, and data scientists](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) as colleagues.

On my mind right now:

- Doing meaningful work on climate change and sustainability. For an inspiring read, I recommend ðŸ“– [All We Can Save](https://www.allwecansave.earth/anthology).
- Bringing meaningful work that I do out of the classroom into my classrooms
- [[writing/favorite problems|My favorite problems]]

This website is a digital garden where I [[writing/index|write]] to remember beautiful ideas and figure out paths forward.

If anything that you stumble upon resonates with you, let's go on a walk together. ðŸŒˆ
