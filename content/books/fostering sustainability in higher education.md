# Chapter 1: Sustainability, Higher Education, and Human Behavior

## Sustainability Defined

> First, sustainability is about taking the long view, or as they say “playing the long game”—a concept that immediately immerses us in psychological territory. We humans are biologically and evolutionarily wired to focus on what is right in front of us and respond to immediate danger, which makes long-term thinking and planning somewhat challenging. *Yet, it is imperative that we focus on the long term.* (Page 2)

> Second, sustainability is an integrated, multidimensional understanding of our future. When we talk about sustainability, it includes social, planetary, and economic flourishing—all of them … together. 
> ...
> it is critical to note that everything we do and have is *completely* dependent on a healthy planet and that economies do not work without healthy people (Page 2)

> Third, sustainability includes a healthy society in which everyone flourishes, not just people with privilege. Sustainability, therefore, highlights a need to focus on diversity, inclusion, and justice. (Page 2)

## The Role of Individuals Within Systems

> Individual action is simply no match for the massive and damaging infrastructure underlying energy, transportation, and agriculture. We build oil pipelines, then ask people to conserve energy. We design car-centric roads, then expect people to walk and bike along them. We subsidize global, monoculture crops, then ask individuals to eat local and organic at a higher personal financial cost. Changing behavior is hard even in supportive circumstances; it is especially difficult when working against giant systems that render more sustainable actions costly, dangerous, or impossible.
> 
> In addition to physical perils, working against large systems is also cognitively punishing. Behaving in ecologically compatible ways within unsustainable systems requires conscious intentions and deliberate actions, both of which use extensive cognitive resources. (Page 4)

## The Role of Higher Education

HEI = higher education institution

- HEIs train our future workforce and thought leaders
- HEIs are supposed to be models of being at the cutting edge of knowledge - time to make that true on the sustainability front with systemic support as opposed to grassroots efforts
- Tenure can make faculty resistant to change
- Mix of top-down leadership and decentralized autonomy makes collaboration challenging and expectations murky
- HEIs are in a competitive market -> this makes investing in sustainability efforts challenging

> HEIs can foster low-cost sustainable behavior—actions that are convenient or inexpensive like recycling—by providing the foundational information that affects knowledge, awareness, attitudes, values, and norms.

But how is this information conveyed? Classrooms? Workshops?

> HEIs can also provide the processes that are most likely to influence high-cost behaviors like attending extensive training programs or redefining jobs or encouraging job crafting among employees—where employees are encouraged to modify aspects of their jobs to align with their personal goals and values. ==For example, faculty can autonomously allocate their “service” workload, which they could transform into an opportunity to engage in university sustainability committees.==

This is exactly what I'm using my sabbatical for!

> In order to transform HEIs into sustainable institutions, we *need* to understand organizational behavior—the reciprocal impacts of organizations and humans. There are many organizational levers, such as job design, leadership, and organizational development processes that can transform individual behavior within the larger institution.


# Chapter 2: Organizational Culture

## What is Organizational Culture?

> Organizational culture is a system of shared meaning, developed within a group, that guides people’s thoughts and behaviors. It includes the values, beliefs, and assumptions that underlie “the way we do things around here.”

> Sustainability, for instance, is fundamentally about responsibility, which is not often an explicit academic value. It may also feel counter to values like productivity. In an HEI, for example, investing in sustainability-related change may appear to divert limited resources from key priorities such as student recruitment and retention. If commitment to investing in a more sustainable future appears to conflict with an organization’s long-standing values, people may react with hesitance or skepticism. ==Working out how values coincide is essential to moving forward successfully.==

When an individual's values don't align with the organizations, the individual may experience dissonance or resistance.

> This suggests that ==diversifying the reasons why one’s organization is pursuing sustainability== (e.g., it makes financial sense in the long run and it appeals to the upcoming demographic of students) can positively engage people who do not yet hold sustainability values.

One locus of action is in shifting the formal and informal rules by which an organization runs:

- **Formal rules:** policies, procedures, systems, codes of conduct, incentives, programs, and practices
- **Informal rules (social norms):** 

**Cultural artifacts** are things that surround us (spaces, stories, practices) that embody our culture. Examples:

- Curriculum
- Narratives, stories told around campus

In HEI environments where top-down organization and individual autonomy mix, it is natural for subcultures to arise. Two prominent **subcultures** among employees are staff and faculty.

> Sustainability is likely to manifest differently in each subculture. This is valuable on one hand since unique interpretations can optimize functionality for each subgroup. Tech departments might focus on energy savings, while social sciences focus on environmental justice. On the other hand, varying subcultures can cause friction if norms are *significantly* different or if the culture as a whole ends up reflecting the subculture with the most resources and power rather than being a truly shared culture.

Sustainable cultures are important to nurture because it encourages people who would otherwise not participate to do so.

## Creating a Sustainability Culture in HEIs

Some strategies are effective:

- Signaling values
    - Written declarations and commitments
    - Mission and vision statements (at classroom, departmental, institutional levels)
- Human resource management (HRM) practices
    - HRM professionals translate mission, vision, and goals into the personnel policies, practices, and structures that drive employee behavior
    - HRM professionals determine how jobs are defined, who is hired, how people are trained, and what efforts are rewarded

# Chapter 3: Sustainability as a Shared Competency

> Supporting sustainability in higher education institutions (HEIs), therefore, requires understanding employees, the scope of possible sustainable behavior they may undertake, and how this may vary with the unique responsibilities and skillset of any individual job.

What specific **in-role** and **extra-role** actions can we advise different campus constituents to take?
