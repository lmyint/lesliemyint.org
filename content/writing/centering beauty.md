Beauty is a moment of arrest. When time stops as we marvel in the presence of something awe-inspring. 

Beauty is connected with joy. We need beauty and joy to make a life worth living. It's what makes the [[writing/saving the world|world worth saving]] -- to give others a chance to experience beauty and joy.

Finding beauty doesn't necessarily have to require going far out of our way. How can we change our perspective to see it in familiar places?

One practice that has brought me joy recently is starting Wendy MacNaughton's [30 Days of Drawing](https://club.drawtogether.studio/t/30-days-of-drawing-2025).
