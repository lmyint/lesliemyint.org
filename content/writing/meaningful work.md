Teaching is very meaningful work. But it is exhausting at the scale and in the manner that I've been doing it. Can I sustain it?

Climate change occupies a lot of my mental space these days. I have been energized by the prospect of working on climate change and sustainability-related issues. Is there an opportunity to work in this space and have it change the way that I approach teaching?

There are many ways to do meaningful work. There is no one right path through life. I am lucky to have the opportunity to transition my work and re-envision. I am also nervous about changes that I may make to my career as I explore these transitions.
